#The purpose of this analysis is the catcher the temperatures of the months of June and December this analysis was requested by W.AVY to determine whether the ice cream surf shop could sustain a year round opening in order for this to happen data analysis had to be done on temperature or weather information for the months of June and December by gathering the weather patterns for these months W. AVY can determine whether or not the ice cream surf shop could sustain a year round opening on the island. Based on the analysis there's no major difference in temperature from the month of June and the month of December therefore I believe it is sustainable to have the ice cream surf shop open year-round as far as the Max temperature in June which is 85 degrees and the Max temperature in December of 83 degrees there is only a two-degree difference in temperature. 
For the month of June there is a standard deviation of 3.25 in a minimum temperature of 64 degrees As for December there's a standard deviation of 3.7 degrees in the minimum temperature 56 degrees


#below all the data analysis images for the month of June and December in these images you will find all the relevant data requested by W. AVY to the terminal well they're not the ice cream surf shop can be open during the month of December.

#For further analysis of these months I would suggest getting analysis and gathering temperature data during 24 hours in a day just to see if it is possible to have this ice cream shop open for 24 hours.
